## Release Process

To create a new release:

1. **Add your changes to the [Unreleased] section** in this CHANGELOG.md file
   - Follow the existing format with appropriate sections (Added, Enhanced, Fixed, etc.)
   - Use descriptive entries with emojis for visual clarity
   - Ensure the [Unreleased] section has meaningful content before releasing

2. **Run the release script**: `./scripts/release.sh v1.x.x`
   - The script will automatically validate the CHANGELOG.md
   - Extract release notes from the [Unreleased] section
   - Update the CHANGELOG.md by moving [Unreleased] content to the new version
   - Update version in `cmd/generate/main.go`
   - Run tests to ensure everything works
   - Create git commit and tag with extracted release notes
   - Create backup files for safety

3. **The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:**
   - Build binaries for all platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS - AMD64/ARM64)
   - Extract release notes from the updated CHANGELOG.md
   - Create GitHub release with the extracted content
   - Upload binaries and checksums
   - Make the release publicly available

### Safety Features:
- **Validation**: Script validates CHANGELOG.md before proceeding
- **Backups**: Automatic backup of CHANGELOG.md before modification
- **Rollback**: Failed operations restore from backup
- **Fallbacks**: GitHub Actions falls back to generic release notes if extraction fails
- **Testing**: Full test suite runs before release creation

### CHANGELOG.md Format Requirements:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- üìä **New Feature** with detailed description
- üéØ **Another Feature** explaining the benefit

### Enhanced  
- Improved existing functionality
- Better performance in specific areas

### Fixed
- Bug fixes and corrections
```

**Important**: Always ensure the [Unreleased] section contains meaningful content before running a release.
